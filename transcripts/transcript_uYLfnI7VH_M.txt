[Music] the date is the 18th of August 1976 at 10:30 a.m. a US Army 2 and 1/2 ton truck arrives at the site of a 98t tall popler tree located in the joint security area which is right in the middle of the Korean demilitarized zone a work party of 15 men pile out of the vehicle including five members of the Korean Service Corp or k C carrying axes the KFC workers set up ladders and begin pruning the branches of the pop Tre while 10 men a mix of South Koreans and Americans from United Nations command stand guard Americans Captain Arthur bonafos and Lieutenant Mark Barrett and South Korean Captain kin munan supervised the pruning within minutes from the opposite side of the sashon river a truck drives across what is known as the bridge of no return pulls up an 11 unarmed soldiers from the Korean People&amp;#39;s Army or North Korean army exit the vehicle and approach the tree their leader Lieutenant Pac Chu demands to know what the work party is doing Captain bonifas responds that they are simply pruning the tree Lieutenant CH agrees that this is a good idea and his men stand around to watch the process some even offering advice to the South Korean workers however at 10:47 a.m. the mood changes it is unknown why but a suddenly agitated Lieutenant pack approaches Captain bonifas with a threat if you cut down more branches there will be big trouble bonifas ignores the request and turns his back on the North Koreans a runner is sent across the bridge and 10 minutes later another North Korean army truck pulls up to the tree 20 North Korean soldiers step out and Lieutenant Pac gives Captain bonifas an ultimatum stop working now or we will kill you before we see how this played out a quick word on this week&amp;#39;s sponsor our very own patreon you may have seen among fellow history creators that views on long form history content across the board are much reduced from even 12 months ago the YouTube algorithm which recommends our videos to people who might be interested in watching them has been updated in a way which intentionally or otherwise suppresses recommendations of History content with a team of people relying on the monetization that comes from views and with fewer views with which to negotiate with sponsors without which we can&amp;#39;t produce videos full stop this has become a major problem for us shorts and YouTube&amp;#39;s own ads which we don&amp;#39;t receive any revenue from also now take up valuable space on the YouTube homepage that would ordinarily be used to recommend long form content YouTube&amp;#39;s demonetization Bots have now run completely out of control with our second channel the Intel report having been recently completely demonetized by mistake only to be eventually reinstated after two appeals we

us financially we appreciate all your support since April 2019 this pruning incident is taking place in the midst of increased tensions between the Western aligned United Nations command and North Korea The Divided Peninsula has been one of the front lines of the Cold War following the 1953 Armistice which froze the war between the capitalist Republic of Korea and communist Democratic People&amp;#39;s Republic of Korea the United Nations command&amp;#39;s task is to protect South Korea in the event of more communist aggression and the joint security area is the only area of the demilitarized zone where both sides come in close contact with each other located just south of the former Village of panjon the joint security area is where diplomacy military negotiations and prisoner swaps are conducted between the UNC and North Korea members of both sides have freedom of movement within the area and it is limited to five armed officers and 30 armed enlisted personnel per side at a time the popular tree by the sashon river has proven to be a major point of contention between both sides the tree must be pruned often because it blocks the line of sight between a UNC checkpoint and a nearby UNCC observation post previous work parties have been harassed by North Korean soldiers including an incident on the 6th of August where US troops were held at gunpoint by Lieutenant ch&amp;#39;s men when kirkbride of the US second Infantry Division later recalled how we were told by North Korean soldiers that you cannot trim this tree because Kim ilon the leader of North Korea personally planted it and nourished it and it&amp;#39;s growing under his supervision luckily Captain bonifas was able to intervene and diffuse the situation without Bloodshed but tension is ramping up again on the 17th of August 1976 the day before the pruning the North Korean government launches a diplomatic offensive on the United States along with 20 other communist Nations the dprk submits a resolution to the United Nations demanding the removal of all UNCC troops and weaponry from South Korea in Sri Lanka North Korean Premier P song Cho delivers a Bellic Co speech at the non-aligned Nations conference claiming that the UNCC and South Korea are preparing to launch a war of aggression the CIA believes this sudden belligerent rhetoric is designed to gain support from the non-allied nations in Sri Lanka for the UN resolution furthermore US President Gerald Ford is currently fighting off a primary Challenge from California governor Ronald Reagan at the Republican National Convention and the dprk&amp;#39;s threats are seen as a way to sew division in the US on the verge of the 1976 Presidential election with this potential conflict boiling in the background Captain bonifas has taken extra precautions to avoid a clash at the tree there have been incidents in the joint security area before including a few occasions where both sides came to blows and bonifas wants to be prepared for anything he repositions a platoon of UNCC soldiers closer to the work site and deploys officers to the observation posts located around the joint security area to increase surveillance additionally two cameras are brought up and pointed towards the tree to ensure any North Korean aggression is caught on film finally he decides he will call an immediate security officer meeting between the two sides if the North Koreans interfere with the pruning despite these precautions the situation continues to deteriorate on the morning of the 18th of August Lieutenant pack who has been nicknamed Lieutenant Bulldog for his many confrontations with UNC Personnel now has 35 North Korean soldiers facing the 15 men in the work party he he gives Captain bonifas one final warning to stop the pruning and the workers hesitate and begin to put down their tools however Captain bonifas orders them to continue and again turns his back to pack it is standard practice for UNCC troops to avoid an armed confrontation By ignoring North Korean threats and Bonas murmurs to Captain Kim of the South Korean army that pack is bluffing what he doesn&amp;#39;t see is pack taking off his watch and placing it into a handkerchief while the other North Korean soldiers begin rolling up their sleeves at just after 11:00 a.m. pack shouts kill the bastards and attacks captain bonifas from behind the North Koreans Rush the work party grabbing axes wooden handles and metal pipes which were brought along by the pruners outnumbered and outarmed the American and South Korean soldiers desperately attempt to defend themselves while the pruners flee the scene Captain bonifas falls to the ground and is budgeon to death by axes and wooden handles by Lieutenant Pac and four North Korean soldiers one attempts to climb into the truck but a GI smacks him in the head with a spare axe handle and tosses more handles to the rest of the UNCC troops Lieutenant Barrett runs towards a depression between the tree and the river before leaping over a low wall to hide the rest of the South Korean and UNC Personnel fights their way to Captain bonas&amp;#39;s body and retrieve it before retreating back to the truck they load his body only for more North Korean soldiers to storm the vehicle trying to pull them out of the back another GI grabs a fire extinguisher and sprays it into one of the North Korean guard&amp;#39;s faces before chucking it at the man&amp;#39;s head knocking him out cold a UNCC truck from a neighboring observation post pulls up and drives into the middle of the North Korean soldiers forcing them to scatter Lieutenant pack and the Koreans disperse carrying five unconscious North Korean soldiers back with them over the bridge of no return the entire fight has lasted just 30 seconds Captain bonifas is dead Lieutenant Barrett is missing and nine UNC Personnel have been injured shortly after the North Koreans pull back across the bridge the UNC Force notices strange behavior from one of the North Korean observation posts a soldier is seen descending into the small depression next to the river with an axe where they out of sight from UNCC Personnel after a few minutes the soldier returns to the post and hands the axe to another man who repeats the process they are taking turns in attacking barretts with an axe after an hour a search and rescue squad is dispatched from The Joint security area to find Lieutenant Barrett they enter the depression to find his mutilated body but Barrett is somehow still alive he is retrieved and rushed to a hospital but dies of his wounds on route as night Falls North Korean soldiers armed with AK-47s gather on their side of the bridge of no return while news of the attack makes his way to Washington the entire attack has been caught on camera just as Captain bonifas hoped hours after the incident US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger informs President Ford of the situation with President Ford busy with the Republican National Convention and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recovering from surgery he authorizes his cabinet to formulate a strong response at around the same time the North Korean government releases a statement accusing US troops in the joint security area of provoking the attack the American imperialist AG grasses sent in 14 hoodlums with axes into the joint security area to cut down the trees against our persuasion they attacked our guards on mass and committed a serious provocative Act of beating our men within 4 hours Kim jongil the son of the North Korean dictator addresses the conference of non-aligned Nations and formerly introduces a resolution condemning the United States and demanding the withdrawal of all UNCC troops from the Korean Peninsula the CIA deduces that the attack in the joint security area was a premeditated act aimed at weakening Western resolve for supporting South Korea secretary Kissinger chairs a meeting of the Washington special Action Group and tells the assembled staff that the response must be a good lesson for the North Koreans the important thing is that they beat two Americans to death and must pay the price Kinja recommends raising the defense Readiness condition to Defcon 3 for only the third time ever and the first time since the Yon capore War 3 years earlier in response the North Korean government increases their defensive Readiness calling out reservists in conducting civilian air raid drills in the capital of pongyang the tth situation seems to rest on a nice Edge Kissinger and the cabinet along with General Richard Stillwell the commander-in-chief of United Nations command in South Korea begin debating their next course of action it is agreed that the UNC will be significantly reinforced with F4 Phantom Fighters and F-111 strike aircraft the USS Midway carrier task group in Yuka Japan is ordered to prepare for immediate departure however Kissinger and Stillwell also want to send a more immediate and firm message that this Behavior will not be tolerated deputy secretary of defense William Clemens pushes for a covert operation by Navy Seals to destroy a North Korean military installation on the west coast of the peninsula a sharp artillery barrage to destroy North Korean positions near The Joint security area is also considered but these ideas are ultimately shelled due to an unfavorable ratio of forces in the panun Jong area should the North Koreans go on the offensive the UNCC forces in the area will not be able to hold them back furthermore South Korean president Park Jung he is vehemently opposed to any course of action that could lead to open War instead the Washington special action group decides on a carefully orchestrated show of force to intimidate the North Koreans into backing down the tree in the joint security area is to be cut down in a way that displays the United States immense military might earlier plans to cut down the tree include ideas to blow it up with satal charges or bomb it using laser guided Munitions but the action group decides on a different plan at 7:00 a.m. on the 21st of August a task force of 8113 men from the US Army support group a South Korean reconnaissance company a South Korean Special Forces company and sections of a reinforced composite rifle company from the US 9th Infantry Regiment will travel to the site of the Axe Murders in 23 vehicles to cut down the tree with chainsaws circling behind them outside of the DMZ will be 20 transport helicopters carrying an entire infantry company and seven ah1 Cobra gunships high above them nuclear capable B52 Strat fortresses will Patrol the Skies over the peninsula escorted by us F4 Phantom and South Korean F5 tigers and f86 Sabers another 12,000 troops are ordered to South Korea while units stationed along the length of the DMZ are put on high alert Bridges and bases near the DMZ are rigged for demolition should the North Koreans launch a full-scale Invasion and air defense assets are moved closer to the Border in anticipation of enemy air strikes by the evening of the 20th of August preparations are complete the plan is Coden named Operation Paul bunan after the mythical North American Lumberjack and folk hero Major General John singl the chief of staff for US forces career later said it was my estimate shared by many of the staff that the operation stood a 50/50 chance of starting a war at 7:00 a.m. on the 21st of August Operation Paul bunion commences without warning the North Koreans the Convoy of vehicles makes its way from Camp Kittyhawk to the southeast of the joint security area to the site of the Axe Murders named task force Fiera after its Commander Lieutenant Colonel Victor Vieira a truck carrying two teams of Engineers from Bravo Company and Charlie Company of the second Engineer Battalion disembark they climb onto the top of their truck and get to work felling the tree with chainsaws the rest of task force Viera assumes a defensive posture and a truck is parted lengthways across the bridge of no return Le also accompanying the UNCC task force are 64 men of the South Korean army first Special Forces Brigade armed with clubs and trained in Taekwondo among them is future South Korean president Moon jayin who is serving in a reserve role upon arriving at the bridge the South Koreans begin handing out M16 assault rifles along with m79 grenade launchers to the men setting up defensive positions with sandbags 5 minutes after the operation Begins the UNC officially informs the North Koreans that a task force has entered the joint security area in order to peacefully finish the work left unfinished on the other Bank of the river the North Korean guards immediately call for reinforcement a convoy of five buses a truck and even an old East German car carries 150 to 200 North Korean soldiers to the scene however they do not exit the vehicles and instead watch the operation unfold Lieutenant Colonel Victor now calls in his air support and the helicopters b52s f-111s and their escorting Fighters Crest The Horizon but do not stray across the DMZ instead the aircraft aggressively charged towards the Border only to bank away at the last second while dozens of transport and attack helicopters hover within view of the North Korean Soldiers the radio net north of the DMZ lights up as multiple North Korean Outpost request instructions on how to handle this sudden escalation back on the ground the North Korean men aboard the buses now exit and begin setting up Twan machine gun positions but continue to not interfere for the next 42 minutes the two heavily armed sides engage in a tense and icy standoff at the front line of the Cold War while the engineers continue their high stakes gardening work the men of the South Korean Special Forces Brigade go the North Koreans to cross the bridge some even strapping M18 Claymore mines to their chest while holding their thumbs on the firing mechanism Lieutenant Colonel Vieira is furious at the South Koreans brazenness but does not order them to stand down the incredible display of aerial might visible in the skies above leaves a big impression on the North Koreans one intelligence analyst monitoring North Korean radio traffic later recalled that the accumulation of force blew their minds two concrete road barriers placed by the North Koreans are removed while South Korean soldiers vandalize two unoccupied North Korean observation posts despite watching their positions being smashed up the North Koreans continue to watch quietly without approaching the work site finally at 7:42 a.m. the work is completed 3 minutes ahead of schedule the 98t tall tree has been felled and only a mutilated stump is left as a warning to to the North Koreans just as quickly as they arrived task force Viera remounts their vehicles and exits the joint security area Staff Sergeant Charles tziki is packing up his chainsaw when he looks towards the river to his surprise he sees a full platon of South Korean Commandos emerged from the bushes with faces painted carrying grenades and automatic weapons that he had no idea where there they were oned to the teeth towards he later said of the Commandos who had been secretly deployed there during the night without notifying the Americans although some shots were fired at a helicopter carrying General Morris Brady 3 hours later the North Koreans have made no provocations anywhere else along the DMZ hours after the operation has finished the North Korean government requests a meeting of the military Armistice commission to be held in the joint security area at the meeting a senior North Korean officer delivers a message to General Stillwell from Kim ilung himself it reads in part it is regrettable that an incident occurred an effort must be made so that such incidents may not recur in the future although not a complete apology this is the first time the dprk has taken responsibility for violence along the DMZ and the first time kimil sun has sent a message to the UNC North Korean media also takes a more conciliatory attitude and its propaganda shifts from an escalatory tone to one of keeping the peace Operation Paul bunion has accomplished its modest goal of chopping down a tree without starting a major war on the 6th of September both sides agree to divide the joint security area and remove guard posts to ensure a similar incident will not occur in the future The Joint security area&amp;#39;s Advanced base is renamed from Camp Kittyhawk to camp bonifas in honor of the Fallen American captain the Readiness Center within Camp bonifas is named in Lieutenant Michael Barrett&amp;#39;s honor in 1984 4 a swagger stick is made from the leftover wood for the commander of the US 8th Army the stick has since been passed down to every eighth Army Commander the baron stump remains within the joint security area for another 11 years until it is finally cut down and replaced with a memorial thanks again to our amazing patrons whose support enables us to make these videos thank you to all our new patrons who joined
