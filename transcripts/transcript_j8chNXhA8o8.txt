and I think you make a good point and a good defense for globalism but I think the exact response would be if you&amp;#39;re the president of the United States you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not looking out for you know the standard of living for all humans or for all people around the globe you&amp;#39;re looking out for the standard of living of people in the United States you know who who you have a constitutional oath to No Doubt but my but my point is that even with that lens you have to think about the Dynamics around the globe and pulling up the wall and trying to get people to make a $40 microwave in America is going to [Music] [Applause] [Music] fail hey Bill it&amp;#39;s great to see you good to see you sir are you going to apply to run the Sovereign wealth fund or actually better yet can I will you give me permission to nominate you to run the Sovereign wealth fund I you know I would think there are people that uh that I&amp;#39;ve met through my days that are LPS at rather large funds that have way better experience for something like that yeah I think you would be a hell of a choice um certainly on maybe on the board of The Sovereign wealth fund but it&amp;#39;s going to be a fascinating experiment one observation I had as as we were getting ready for the Pod today is last night I was helping uh Lincoln study for his AP History exam and you know he&amp;#39;s studying the guilded age and and more importantly kind of the McKinley presidency and and it&amp;#39;s all about the McKinley tariffs and I said to him it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing that you and I are working on the same thing you know I&amp;#39;m reading on chat gbt about the McKinley tariffs and he said yeah but Dad don&amp;#39;t worry about it you don&amp;#39;t have to take the test and I said no worse yet I have to figure out how much money to be exposed to the market what are what our risk going to be in the hedge fund I said don&amp;#39;t worry I get a I get a I get a scorecard on that too yeah um a little weightier than the test yeah no doubt I mean you and I could go full Lex Friedman today by the way his five hours show pod recently with Dylan those guys was great but we&amp;#39;re going to try to keep this you know pretty tight and jam quickly on deep seek on tariffs on Doge on you know maybe what the market reaction might be to all of these things and as I was thinking about this setup bill you know I thought it would be helpful you know you and I got into this and we said we wanted the Pod to be about this intersection of tech and markets investing in capitalism and we specifically kind of wanted to stay away from Washington and and and politics but it&amp;#39;s really possible at the moment to talk about capitalism and markets and and what&amp;#39;s happening without talking about the big things occurring in Washington so we&amp;#39;re going to do that but we&amp;#39;re really going to try to stick to the economic and market lens of the events that are happening rather than the political lens they&amp;#39;re incredible pods you can listen to to give you kind of the political analysis of all of this so uh maybe we just dive in yeah that&amp;#39;d be great and listen I mean it when you expand the lens to include that and you look at the ridiculous um pace of of innovation in the AI space I don&amp;#39;t ever recall a single time in my career where it feels like you could just have your ear to the ground 247 and you&amp;#39;re picking up something new constantly no doubt about it no doubt about it um speaking of you know we covered deep seek last week bill it seems like it was just yesterday but A lot&amp;#39;s happened since then for one these usage charts for deep seek are really uh quite amazing andreon tweeted this you know which shows the percentage of of daus uh relative to chat GPT you know they top GEOS I think they have something like 15% in India and like 10% in China uh 8% in Indonesia it&amp;#39;s really a global phenomenon you know one of the things I that struck me after all of this is you tweeted it&amp;#39;s a better world if the most disruptive llm model is foreign and open source versus domestic and propriety right as you said it&amp;#39;s better for safety for security for free speech Etc so talk us through where you think we we we stand today based on a little space now reflecting on R1 you know and and we know that you and Benchmark have been like the staunchest proponents of Open Source over the course of the last few decades help us help us understand how you think open source versus closed source is going to evolve yeah and so so so let me give you some some Reflections now having having this been a week in the in the rearview mirror and reading and watching as much as I can of other people talking so um here here are some things I think we know about deep seek can R1 the it was quite Innovative you know point one and if you have five hours to listen to Dylan and and Nathan Lambert on Lex Freeman they get into some of this they um deep seek had put more experts simultaneously against a problem they were able to do that because they figured out a way to um separate the parameters and work on things with smaller parameter counts faster which um no one else had done before and so you end up with something that&amp;#39;s cheaper and faster and and it&amp;#39;s just important to recognize that they did innovate right versus just copy because I think doubt there&amp;#39;s a lot of noise around this whole thing um three they did choose to be the most open model we know of today and there a lot of people that like to get into Nuance conversation about whether it&amp;#39;s truly open source I I guess people are hoping for one day when someone shows all the data and all the training processes and so they may have been short of that but with the MIT license which has no restriction whatsoever on how you do this and open weights um it gives a lot of freedom to a lot of people to take this thing and run in opposite directions which I&amp;#39;ll come back to the thing you mentioned is is also I think wor noting the success was a breakthrough and and maybe not compared to open AI Al you know but certainly I think mistol or anthropic or any of these players would have loved to have had the the launch moment if you will the deep sea cat and and weren&amp;#39;t able to achieve it for whatever reasons I don&amp;#39;t know if we can fully explain why you know this app is still number one in the app store today um I I I the thing you mentioned that I think is super interesting as rest of world you know and and we&amp;#39;re going to go into you know how this might play into China us you know sanctions and restrictions and rest of the world could be up for grabs a couple of other points I think worth mentioning one it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s validated now that they went around Cuda and I just think that&amp;#39;s interesting like it&amp;#39;s interesting to think about why it&amp;#39;s interesting to think about performance optimization and how you might get down to the bare metal you know when we went from on Prim software to SAS places like AWS they started pulling out as many layers as they could to get to optimization and so you ended up with very special versions of Linux and whatnot where things are just ripped out and ripped out and ripped out so I think that&amp;#39;s worth noting and and I&amp;#39;ve I know of at least another example where someone that&amp;#39;s working on inference optimization went underneath as well and then and then the last point I would make that I think is just worth understanding you and I stumbled upon I think with the help of Sunny this interview in Chinese with the founder and we translated and read it and I think it&amp;#39;s impossible to read that and and say this isn&amp;#39;t an exceptional founder like he&amp;#39;s just intelligent independently minded I I I I think it&amp;#39;d be very hard to to to make an argument that he&amp;#39;s not a remarkable founder and and of course of course you&amp;#39;re referring to lingwen yes um you know the founder of deep sea and we&amp;#39;ll put the link to that interview and you can you can copy it and put it into chat gbt or whatever and get a quick translation well and Bill as you know you know our our team knows him quite well and and knows a lot of members of the deep seek team but you know he&amp;#39;s become really a national hero in China and you know I think it&amp;#39;s a you know there&amp;#39;s a little bit more of a of a telescope on him today but we did we did learn some things when we talked to the Deep seek team and a few of those I think are pretty salient and and I I I would share again just setting the table for kind of the facts that I think a lot of them are very confirmatory of what what you just had to say number one he&amp;#39;s an incredible founder like there is no doubt about that he&amp;#39;s been working on this problem for upwards of of a decade been thinking about it he&amp;#39;s very successful and and has made a lot of money uh you know in the hedge fund business and so you know it reminds me a little bit of the Jim Simon story at Renaissance right these are brilliant folks who happen to apply this this early Ai and deep learning Edge to uh you know to to the hedge fund business and Quant trading but you know a couple of the key things that were debated last week one was the total compute capex and when you take power into account it really does it does get you closer to this billion dollars of TCO um which was out there you know discussed which is similar I think to the TCO of of the comparative models now of course they talked about the $6 million final training run and this it&amp;#39;s important to understand this is also correct right and as I said on CNBC this compares to about 10 or 15 million for 01 out of open AI so Apples to Apples they were 30 to 50% more efficient to your earlier point about real algorithmic breakthroughs now of course they were doing this a few months later um maybe maybe six to8 months later than what was going on at open AI so it&amp;#39; expect some of those savings but take nothing away from them a lot of them were came from algorithmic improvements many of which I think are going to be copied but but breakthroughs nonetheless I I would add one thing to that which is just worth paying attention to and Dylan and Nathan went into this on the Lex pod but but they believe so I I can&amp;#39;t really defend it they believe if you look at models that are apples to apples on the API right now that that deep seeks pricing about 12th of open Ai and so and they argue about whether openi might just have Mar higher margins or or whether deep seek might be subsidizing but that differential is bigger than the ones you than the one you describe for training yeah no you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re referencing what it what they&amp;#39;re charging the customer for inference and remember you know like and it gets to a couple other points I&amp;#39;m about ready to make they can run it well below cost or they could choose to be running at well below cost in order to to have these outcomes I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s going to last and open AI might be charging well you know well above cost for that but but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s keep going I think I think lift endured rides well below cost for a decade yeah no you you could do it for a very long time so in that regard but let&amp;#39;s get back to the compute stock because this was something we learned from their team that I think is really important to understand their compute stack was smaller than the compute stack that open AI used to train 01 but it wasn&amp;#39;t that much smaller okay and so the problem they now face is that this changes D dramatically remember these are log linear scaling functions so in order to get to kind of the 03 level now they got a 10x the amount of compute right assuming that they don&amp;#39;t come you know through with some massive architectural improvements that cause them to be able to do log linear scaling without more compute right but to get to that next step function they acknowledge it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot harder so set another way this was the moment in time where their compute comparison to open AI was the closest it&amp;#39;s ever going to be for a few reasons number one&amp;#39;s with with the export controls they acknowledge they they&amp;#39;re going to have a very hard time keeping up with 03 and and Stargate going to be even much more challenging they&amp;#39;re not going to have access to Blackwell that is you know 2 to 3x Improvement on top of the hopper series which already exists this differential in gpus is is as they begin to train 03 is far greater than it was for 01 on top of that we learned uh you know they are massively compute constrained right now so you&amp;#39;ve seen some tweets about this people that are you know getting server delay and all this stuff with with these guys because of their massive success so they have a limited cluster to begin with and they&amp;#39;re current deploying they&amp;#39;re currently taking most of that compute and deploying it against inference right just to support the demand that they have coming in the door which further constrains their ability to do training and we know they got a 10x the training to get to that next you know to that next fun function so this is a a a really tough situation I think you know and we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll get into this the export controls remember on 01 they already had somewhere in the order of 30 to 50,000 gpus that they had previously purchased and there&amp;#39;s a lot of debate exactly how many they had but the differential wasn&amp;#39;t that great but now when you have to step up to 10x that it becomes very challenging so that we learn those are things that we think we&amp;#39;ve confirmed you know directly directly from the company and so I would expect one of the things that would impress me even more bill you know I asked the team at open AI like what did this surprise them did deep seek surprise them and they said the only thing that surprised him is that it was a Chinese company that was able to get there before meta and others right um and I think it&amp;#39;s a really important question the thing that would impress me even more if somehow they figure out an architectural or algorithmic way to catch up with 03 and deep research and the stuff that&amp;#39;s now you know really truly Frontier without having access to gpus that will to me be the definitive you know kind of the statement that they have somehow breaking the broken the Paradigm on on cost and you know scaling yeah and we we wouldn&amp;#39;t be the first person to say it because even freed zakari said it on on his show on National Television but you know everyone&amp;#39;s talking about the fact that constraints can lead to Innovation and and the reason llama probably didn&amp;#39;t do it is they had access to to scaling and so only if you&amp;#39;re limited on that function might you making algorithmic change my guess is and we could have one or something that that Nathan Lambert might disagree with you about the 10x requirement but I will say this because it&amp;#39;s open because they publish the paper I&amp;#39;m 100% certain that people at anthropic and at open AI are studying what deep seek did so if there was some Innovative breakthrough it&amp;#39;s going to the borrowing is going to be bidirectional and it&amp;#39;s going to go right back and then that gets you into jeans&amp;#39;s Paradox which everyone else is also talking about which is if we make this stuff cheaper isn&amp;#39;t people are just going to buy more and more but let me go back to your original question real quick on open source because I do think there that I never really got around to answering it and I there are some things that I think are worth mentioning so as you said I tweeted you know I think a lot of people were worried about these models and whether they&amp;#39;re control people what people say and disinformation and what&amp;#39;s embedded in them and what do they do you know I&amp;#39;m a big believer and many many people in Academia are as well that more transparency leads to more um standing more safety more security more free speech this kind of thing so and and I&amp;#39;m not the only one that said this if you had a singular model proprietary from a singular company it would on all those fronts would give you more risk more ability for someone to control that kind of thing and let&amp;#39;s be very clear the very reason open AI exists right I remember when Elon first talked about it on stage at launch was to defend against singular control by Google of a en closed tyrannical AI so so I put those all in one group and then I then I said look it&amp;#39;s also better for Innovation you know startups cost performance and um Global prosperity and um I&amp;#39;ll give you a data point I I was talking with Clen over at hugging face and so like 48 hours after R1 was posted they had 500 variants on hugging face and today I pinged them this morning before we started they&amp;#39;re up to 1300 and so these are just Forks in different directions right and it allows people to do massive optimization it allows people to solve problems any concern you may have about R1 someone can go work on you know if it Linus&amp;#39;s law from the original but Bazaar and Cathedral paper was given enough eyes all bugs are shallow and this thing like the R&amp;amp;D Force becomes the world not just an individual player and so it allows for so much optimization um it also makes enterprise companies happy so Aaron Levy and and Mark benof were out there very boldly supporting this R1 breakthrough and it just makes sense right if there&amp;#39;s a piece of technology that&amp;#39;s a commodity that they need to be successful they&amp;#39;re better off than if there&amp;#39;s some proprietary piece they have to license from someone and it was quickly deployed in all the clouds in you know in AWS and in in a was shocking to me uh especially especially the Microsoft deployment so obviously that feels like a piece of the the Strategic back and forth between open AI Microsoft around this contract but yet everybody went up fast um and it just shows you what&amp;#39;s possible and and I think the amount of innovation that you can have and and not just up the stack I think you know people say oh that&amp;#39;s going to allow people to build Special models and all this stuff but down the stack as well if you you know are trying to compete with Nvidia um you know with with a TPU or a non-gpu we&amp;#39;ve talked about all these companies before or you know we we&amp;#39;re an investor in a company called fireworks that&amp;#39;s trying to be this optimization middle layer high like high performance uh inference and they have a lot of really amazing um C customers doing runtime inference right now production knowing more about the model allows them to optimize even more and so I think the the rest of everybody else other than the big proprietary models are probably thrilled to have this type of of product out there and and once again the variants will just will go and everyone will borrow from it and hey Bill Bill can I can I just have pause for a second sure you know a year ago there was a lot of excitement about llama okay and and and and Zuck really took the leadership on kind of Open Source in the US and you know here we are evangelizing you&amp;#39;re evangelizing about open source but it&amp;#39;s not about llama right it&amp;#39;s about it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s about deep seek and R1 what do you think happened there do you just think it&amp;#39;s scarcity and the leap frog you know obviously there are lots of reports that that there was a lot of uh uh trauma within within the metaplex last week um people very upset about you know the fact that they were Leap Frog here and the amount of money they&amp;#39;re spending and they didn&amp;#39;t get there first um but any speculation by you as to to why why not them I I&amp;#39;ve watched um different open source battles in a whole bunch of different vertical since my my firm was an original investor in Red Hat um I think 99 so 25 years ago and there&amp;#39;s always a Continuum of openness and there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of licenses I I I tweeted this list of of like a hierarchy or Continuum of licenses and they&amp;#39;re from from most open to least open and almost every company that tries to play in the in the open source area is playing this weird game where they want the proliferation of openness but they want some kind of hook to be able to to kind of claw back and have proprietary advantage and so you know we know that meta had not gone fully open the weights they had never published the weights and there was this Clause that says if you use too much you got to come see us again and that Clause got got spread around last yeah so so so folks like Amazon actually have to pay meta for the use of of llamas right and so they were playing that game that same game that all these companies have played [ __ ] and Alaska like they&amp;#39;ve all they&amp;#39;ve all had to play this game and so yeah so it looks like these guys just decided to be more open and the MIT license is pretty against the rail um and and and as I said there are people that say they could be even more open um but this is the most open um for sure um today so keep keep going on actually let me make let me let me make two last statements and then and then we can shift so one um China I think it&amp;#39;s really interesting um to know that China&amp;#39;s not a newcomer to open source if you look at all of the major projects like Linux or MySQL and most of these um open- Source projects have a website and you can see who the leading donors are and just go to the Linux one I&amp;#39;ll put a link in here from the Linux um member group and you&amp;#39;ll see a ton of Chinese companies and someone may say why is China Pro open source well for the past 30 years the West has done nothing but accuse them of being IP theves and so if you believe you have the fastest cheapest most capable entrepreneurs or Engineers that can run faster and work harder than everyone else you&amp;#39;d rather live in a world where there&amp;#39;s no IP protection than one where you&amp;#39;re just being held back and so I think they jumped into open source um Full Throttle and and it you know it&amp;#39;s not just Linux it&amp;#39;s not just this if you look at risk five they&amp;#39;re one of the biggest supporters of risk five um and every time we put more constraints on what they can get to they invest more in Risk five and so and and I think this is particularly important relative to the rest of the world as we brought up earlier because and we&amp;#39;ll get into this we&amp;#39;ll get into sanctions and whatnot but if you pull the wall up and we don&amp;#39;t support open source and they do and everybody else kind of likes them leading that way oh that could be a dangerous situation um and then the last point I just want to make I want to go back to fared zakari I&amp;#39;m a big fan of his um he had two takeaways on deep seek and I I I was impressed that he um landed on both of these um but one was that that there was a lot of discussion especially in Washington that the US was two years ahead of China and he he said look it looks like after the fact that that that&amp;#39;s huous right if if if that&amp;#39;s now six months three months whatever it&amp;#39;s closing and we need to think I think with our eyes wide open as we make policy decisions um and and I think that&amp;#39;s important and then the second one I was just really impressed with his standing of open versus closed and how um you can reach a Tipping Point where things just move in that direction because so many different entities get behind it I like to see water runs downhill okay so Sam Alman did this AMA last week and he was asked about deep seek and about open source um and I I thought his response was really interesting Bill he said deep seeks an impressive model uh you know and to your point about Jeff&amp;#39;s Paradox he&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re going to need a lot more compute you know because you know as as we&amp;#39;ve said demand for this is exploding their compute constraint Etc he said and on the issue of Open Source they said would you consider releasing model weights and and and Publishing your open source research and Sam said yes we are discussing I personally think we have been on the wrong side of History here and we need to figure out a different open- Source strategy so I tweeted in response to you know something Mark Andre has said that I that I thought all current closed Source model companies right so let&amp;#39;s just say open open Ai and and anthropic would open source their models and that in the case of open AI I could see them open sourcing 01 which competes head tohe head with deep seek at the same time I could see all companies that are currently open source and closed right which includes deep seek I could see them in the future and Mark Zuckerberg has said he reserves the right not to release all the models in the future right so I think we may end up with a world where the true Frontier the actual underlying model is not released at all and the only thing that gets released is the agent right but then one or two generations behind you&amp;#39;re going to see them all open- sourcing these models but let&amp;#39;s start with Sam&amp;#39;s comments are you encouraged that Sam has said yes we need to come out you know we&amp;#39;re on the wrong side of History here well I mean to a certain extent it it validates what R1 did right that he would feel the need to say that I have found just and you talk to him more than me but I found that whenever a threat or a challenge is made to open AI Sam tends to go towards it like that&amp;#39;s his kind of go-to move and and I think it works for him like and so I&amp;#39;m not surprised that he said that um I I I was surprised um on a side note that a a couple of our friends who are co-investors with un open AI when the R1 thing hit kind of very quickly took to X to say that you know some that ran cheated or that the government needed to come in and to me that was a validation Point as well like you wouldn&amp;#39;t take the trouble if this thing wasn&amp;#39;t real but yeah it could it could tip us more towards open I I mean as a as a as someone who who really enjoyed my uh business school classes on finance and economics you know one of the reasons I like open source so much is it&amp;#39;s the closest thing to pure competition if you look up in an economics book pure competition is like commodity like hard to have you know prices leads to you know Innovation low price points jein Paradox blowing up um and so I&amp;#39;m thrilled that it&amp;#39;s tilting that direction now this may be a perfect time to transition into the the other thing that happened as a result of R1 which is there are a number of increased um efforts to I think raise the wall of Regulation and sanctions and it it&amp;#39;s funny I watched a number of people go oh my God look at R1 you know Washington must act quickly but but but the thing that each person intended are radically different from one another you know some people think this means oh we need to embrace open source and encourage more open innovation in America and the other people think oh my God you know and and Dario put out a long piece you know I guess consistent with his entire tenure here just begging for more lockdown and regulation so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go into that because I do think it&amp;#39;s industry interesting right Sam and the industry response seems to be tipping more in the direction where we&amp;#39;re going to go open too and my suspicion is you will see that this year uh you you know out of folks like like open AI but the discussion about deep seek clearly touched a national nerve right Jensen uh you know got got called to the White House La last Friday or we all see may I think they said it was prescheduled well not I&amp;#39;m not sure whether or not that was the case but let&amp;#39;s assume it was but it&amp;#39;s opened up this broader conversation about whether the US can or even whether it&amp;#39;s wise for the US to try to stop China from advancing along the AI Frontier right and and some of the arguments are human talent in China will always find a way to innovate you know uh keeping keeping China six months behind is not worth a cost scarcity fuels Innovation it turns AI into a global arms race or or or the one that I&amp;#39;ve been AR you know been been advocating is I think we we&amp;#39;ve focused so much on slowing China down we haven&amp;#39;t focused enough on speeding America up right removing removing the regulations around power generation all the things we need to get America running full speed but I would say this is probably the biggest divide in Silicon Valley among technologists regarding you know kind of This president&amp;#39;s policies right so there&amp;#39;s a camp as you know of China Hawks led by you know folks like you know Alex karp was on the paler call last night who view this as an existential holy war and that we must battle on every front and you know in order to slow China down and then I would say there are people who are more what I would consider China constructivists and I put you in that camp I would I would put myself in that camp I would put frankly uh you know Elon in that in that camp and others who seem to think that it&amp;#39;s a losing battle just to focus on slowing China down and what we really need to focus on is more engagement and speeding the us up so can you lay out a little bit you know your views on on on those two Computing sides and where we may end up uh coming down on those Brad I think you framed it perfectly the the the problem is that the by the way there I think on the on the anti-china side in Silicon Valley you have you have like three groups you have the people like Dario who are you know maybe worried about competition maybe worried about more but certainly question that you have the new kind of VC back defense companies who all and maybe I kind of put paler in that group but they all uh I think have a incentive to kind of have tension with China if you will it actually increases Revenue I call them the new neocons and then and then I think you just have a large group of people who were raised um to be anti-china um they just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s what they were taught growing up it&amp;#39;s the anti-communist thing it&amp;#39;s what got us into the Vietnam War it&amp;#39;s been around forever but but your parents might have taught you that like it&amp;#39;s just in the ethos one thing I would add to you on the wrist side you listed them you listed a lot of great points you know one thing I would add is that protection of us companies causes harm like like the Detroit is not globally competitive anymore and putting tariffs on byd&amp;#39;s cars is not going to make Detroit more competitive it&amp;#39;s going to make them less competitive and they&amp;#39;re going to fall further behind and I think this idea of raising the wall and increased decoupling um is a super dangerous idea we we may find that the rest of the world is perfectly fine buying $10,000 byd cars and using deep seek um and we may we may just be shutting ourselves off I found this interesting data point I wanted to share with you I to to highlight my fascination with China I I&amp;#39;ve kind of studied it over a very long time frame it turns out most people have no reason to know this but in 1820 um China&amp;#39;s economy was wide open and they actually um had 33% of the global economy 33% of global GDP was China most people probably wouldn&amp;#39;t know that and the reason they might not know it is because 150 years later at the end of Mao&amp;#39;s Reign and Ma had raised the wall and and kind of turned China inwards um they had fallen to 5% of global GDP and they&amp;#39;ve been working their way back from that so we know the emerging China from that place but you know that&amp;#39;s the real risk you know if you&amp;#39;re not a globalist if you don&amp;#39;t believe in you know all the great economic work that shows how you know specialization can work to the benefit of everyone and you close that wall you may be surprised at what happens to wrap this section and that&amp;#39;s the perfect segue to talk about terrorist but you know I would say this um I think there is a middle ground right um I you know I took a little when I first read your Tweet you would rather you know it&amp;#39;s better for an open source Chinese model to win versus a foreign oh foreign okay I knew I knew what the hell you meant uh then a then a closed us model I want Team America to win on this I want a you know I would love to see the US uh Frontier Labs open- Source more stuff I agree with you fundamentally on the principles of Open Source I believe they will and and unquestionably I want to see uh the US win when it comes to the race in Ai and I know you do too secondly um I I would say on this is that I think a lot of the things that we&amp;#39;ve done in the name of being tough on China right are actually counterproductive I agree it takes the eye off the prize it slows us down right and it it doesn&amp;#39;t focus on speeding us up and frankly it&amp;#39;s not very effective or it backfires entirely in terms of slowing China down and and one of the places where I think that this uh bill you know takes us to is is is really Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs uh that that that that brought you know brought brought us to the four this week but you have something to say yeah I I just want to say two things to what you said and then we&amp;#39;ll go to the tariffs so one you know I I was being provocative when I said foreign and you could read China but if you think about it like Linux doesn&amp;#39;t have a geography right and so one possible reality that I don&amp;#39;t think meet your goal of America wins is you get to a place that&amp;#39;s Linux likee where the the model doesn&amp;#39;t have a sovereignty and and um because of the 1300 variants of R1 that are on hugging face already like the and because of that MIT license those it could be that model that wins you know it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the one that they&amp;#39;re doing it could be a fork of it so anyway I wanted to make that point and then the other thing I wanted to say on just just on a wrist side you know and and by the way there there are proposals in Congress right now I just that that would kill open source that would say we couldn&amp;#39;t use variants of R1 there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s like a lot there&amp;#39;s a huge bre of of perspectives as you already said but I think if you I think I can imagine that if you just poke China enough if you keep poking and you keep poking and you keep raising the constraints you increase the odds that they make a run at Taiwan and I I just think it&amp;#39;s important to always think from their perspective you know and and I I just think we need to be careful about how how how hard we push we may end up with the exact worst outcome unintended consequences right so this week we woke up uh you know or really ended Friday at a late press conference the president had and then it went into effect over the weekend right 25% tariffs on on on Mexico and Canada 15% tariff or 10 10 to 15% tariff on China before we dive into the the economic debates for and against tariffs let&amp;#39;s just kind of lay this out you know so Monday morning the markets overnight Sunday the markets are falling a lot Monday morning Kevin hasset chairman of the National Economic Council comes out on the White House law and he said oh these are all being misinterpreted this is not about a trade War this is a drug war there&amp;#39;s about fent andol you know he did happen to say we may revisit in the future as part of a tax reform form strategy so he left the opening to to you know tariffs for other reasons then the president on Monday talks to both sides they both commit 10,000 troops to the border to fight Fentanyl and you delay the tariffs for 30 days um and I think the market reaction now is that they&amp;#39;re not going to hit at all so let&amp;#39;s first start on what we think happens here so help me predict what you think happens and then I would love to get into kind of the merits and demerits from an economic and from maybe the tech industry perspect perspective on on on this tariff strategy so Brad I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going to be brief because look this is more your world than mine you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re looking at a lot of large public companies and and all all the things that impact them you know even I guess even in the medium-sized public companies I work with especially if you have physical Goods you you&amp;#39;ve got Supply chains all around the globe right and I imagine one thing you&amp;#39;ve had to do in your shop you know is when a new tariff pops up is just immediately ask well who&amp;#39;s impacted who sources there who like who who has and you know it probably just creates a lot of chaos right in the short term as we try and figure those things out um you know there&amp;#39;s different foxcon plants all around the globe right and different People&amp;#39;s Source um different you know whether it&amp;#39;s fashion products or anything you know from Vietnam or from Indonesia or from China um during Co I think one of the things we realized is there is some flexibility ility they can move um move a lot faster than people thought um but it&amp;#39;s still chaotic and based on like I as I said you know my default is a globalist now I don&amp;#39;t know enough to know if we have unfair deals that need to be honed and that this is just a means to an end and if so maybe it&amp;#39;s not that big a deal I don&amp;#39;t believe that creating a lot of you know bringing the wall up as I said earlier around AI I don&amp;#39;t believe that&amp;#39;ll be in the US&amp;#39;s long-term best interest you make a a good point about you know clearly Trump extracted a concession that was a pretty damn good concession from Canada and Mexico when it when it comes to defending the border right so uh as a tactical negotiating tool you know his batting average is exceptionally High you know whether it it&amp;#39;s getting Colombia to take the detained deep Ortiz where he threatened a tariff and so I think that that&amp;#39;s the Market&amp;#39;s reflexive belief in fact Scott bessent the treasury secretary in a letter he wrote about a year ago to his investors he he used this concept that Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs you shouldn&amp;#39;t be afraid of them because he said his strategy was to have a fully loaded gun but rarely discharge yeah right fully loaded gun but rarely discharge and so the interpretation is he&amp;#39;s just using this as a big stick to achieve very tactical goals now I call this bill the bessent consensus I believe this is the market consensus view the best consensus but I want to throw out an alternative view right I think that Trump May in fact have a much much deeper and more principled belief in tariffs if you listen to his speeches if you read him and this goes back over a decade okay he believes that McKinley was one of the best presidents he thinks that the country he believes that the country and their arguments for this was at its peak or at its best during Peak tariffs in 1880 and that you could in fact replace or when we move to replace tariffs so prior to 1910 which is when we got the income tax right the vast majority we&amp;#39;ll put this chart in the Pod the vast majority of Revenue to the US government came from tariffs and then you see starting in 1910 basically revenue from tariffs plummeted and the amount of Revenue that came from income tax and Social Security tax uh you know thereafter skyrocketed and so I think there&amp;#39;s a belief that replacing tariffs with high income taxes and corporate taxes has gutted the middle class not only did it destroy jobs in America but it in fact caused these people to be burdened with taxes uh you know to pay for social social services that could have otherwise been paid for by tariffs so that to me is a variant view right if you believe that to be true that there is a much more principled architecture that he wants to move to that this is not the best consensus which is have a fully loaded gun that&amp;#39;s rarely discharged but it&amp;#39;s a fully loaded gun that you fully intend to to discharge so let&amp;#39;s assume for the moment that he does have that view maybe more of a fortress America right um I think you&amp;#39;ve outlined where where you stand on this you believe that that hurts us technologically and it would hurt us in in in terms of our global economic standing is that right well look I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not a uh a tariff expert but but when you told me you wanted to talk about this I I did I did some research and maybe maybe we could have your son or or your son&amp;#39;s Professor on to talk more about this but all of the um even the success stories around tariff if you ask your favorite AI to tell you they seem very short windowed even the McKinley ones were were like four years so I don&amp;#39;t know of a long-term success uccessful High tariff program and I think it gets back to what I was saying about China like pulling up the wall is uh I don&amp;#39;t think I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any economic argument that that works to help a country in the long run um and and going back to the to the I I do want to take a a brief SEC second to talk about what you just said about um the like the American middle class may have been been affected by this you know there there&amp;#39;s a time and place when a country is in a great place to be competitive globally in scaling out production um and it it it relates to having a educated Workforce that has a very low standard of living that&amp;#39;s willing to work for a wage that&amp;#39;s highly competitive um globally and may be willing to work 996 you know right like like way more hours than 9 in the morning to 9 at night 6 days a week right and so if you look at when America you know was mostly successful scaling out it&amp;#39;s post World War II where Europe&amp;#39;s been decimated and Japan&amp;#39;s been decimated yeah and we had a lot of people moving up the the the social ladder um and and prosperity ladder as as a result of being willing to do that you know if you fast forward to to where we are today you know I I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any way to say this other than to be blunt like there are people in China Vietnam Indonesia Mexico that are willing to work harder and longer for a wage that is radically lower than what people in the US are willing to work and they&amp;#39;re going to move from a place on the prosperity and social ladder that&amp;#39;s low to a place that&amp;#39;s still beneath the average American and I don&amp;#39;t know how as a humanist you can say that don&amp;#39;t deserve that right and and I think we misinterpret that this is somehow a result of tariffs or trade it&amp;#39;s just Global fairness right it&amp;#39;s just my point of view no totally and I think you make a good point a good defense for globalism but I think the exact response would be if you&amp;#39;re the president of the United States you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re not you&amp;#39;re not looking out for you know the standard of living for all humans or for all people around the globe you&amp;#39;re looking out for the standard of living of people in the United States you know who who have a constitutional oath to it no doubt but my but my point is that even with that lens you have to think about the Dynamics around the globe and pulling up the wall and trying to get people to make a $40 microwave in America is going to fail like you&amp;#39;re just going to end up with more expensive products we watched this happen in Europe like we watched it play out in Europe you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re just going to make yourself Europe I I I do think there are some great economic arguments on this like I said Kevin hasset is Chairman of the National Economic Council who at the Hoover Institute you know he&amp;#39;s going to be on the front lines of carrying the Tariff policy defending the Tariff policy but if you look at the McKinley tariffs they certainly caused a lot of strife uh but they&amp;#39;re very good arguments that they helped us uh industrialized in a way we never would have and more importantly they helped us build critical strength heading into World War I so had we not done the industrialization in 1880 1890 would we have been even prepared but the world does look very different today Bill Global Supply change the cost of shipping is radically lower Etc but I thought what was interesting is you know the FED actually did a study on on uh the the Terrace in 2018 they did it I think it was on washing machines you know and they they basically said it led to a lot higher pricing for for washing machines right um where there were uh you know tariffs put on them and and even for dryers that had no tariff put on them but because they&amp;#39;re usually sold together the prices went on on those as well and interestingly enough even the domestic producers rais prices because now the competitive market had raised prices so they now had a price an umbrella that they could raise prices into and I think they concluded that very few jobs were actually created now they were looking at this only two years in a rear bill so they you know again they weren&amp;#39;t looking at the long run effects of you know did did this play out so I I think you know one one area I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m really focused on for Silicon Valley so imagine a tariff on uh you know on gpus or on chips right which has been threatened this week like they&amp;#39;re talking about t just a tarff on Taiwan which is a ter on chips all right and today we we actually can&amp;#39;t make those chips in America right we we do don&amp;#39;t have two nanometer 3 nanometer Fabs where we could build them even if we wanted to so when I look at that that&amp;#39;s really just a a tax on chip manufacturers and on the end buyers right so that would be attack on on the nvidias and amds and and and others and it would be a tax on meta and Amazon and all the folks that would have to have to pay that tax which which likely means that you get less chips purchased and less AI research right so if our number one goal is to win the race in AI this is a classic case where in the short run I think it&amp;#39;s self-defeating but I do think there are ways to do this where you can bring more Fabs to the US but if you wanted to have you know if you want to have a permanent 50% tariff on all chips in the US starting now I think like that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s just going to have negative repercussions but if you said of a 50% tax on chips but I&amp;#39;m going to delay it for 2 and 1/2 years and you have to meet these hurdles for building Fabs in the US Etc so more of a negotiating tactic than it is kind of a permanent and higher tax um I think there are some you know some some really good outcomes of that we&amp;#39;re less dependent upon Taiwan which is you know always threatened by a you know what what what most people believe is a foreign adversary you know less dependency in the case of of some situation evolving there so I think it&amp;#39;s going to have to be something that we watch but the main thing I wanted to point I wanted to make today on this is don&amp;#39;t be lazy in believing the best consensus don&amp;#39;t think that this is just about um you know a negotiating tactic go back and read the speeches I think Trump and Trump&amp;#39;s Administration has a much more principal view here that maybe a value added tax equivalent a tariff that is is somehow you know appr proxy for these value added taxes is a more efficient and better mechanism for helping the middle class in the United States than an income tax and and you know and and we saw that that back door was kind of left open you know we said Terrace maybe we may come back to Terrace as part of tax reform so uh keep your eyes out for that well then look any analysis of this situation is made more difficult by the um blatant reality that even if Trump is just using tariffs as a negotiating he can never say that out loud or it would take away the uh their ability to be used in that way so he has to be obscure about it either direction and so it makes it harder to know exactly what which way&amp;#39;s up so let&amp;#39;s move on to do so you were in Washington what what took you to Washington and and and what did you see what&amp;#39;s your perspective of Doge and and like I I&amp;#39;d love the the the update on your specific visit but then could you reflect on why or why not Doge matters to a tech investor yeah no I think this is so I think it&amp;#39;s so important because I think again like with tariffs we&amp;#39;re in this foga war bill right where you know you like there change brings a lot of contentiousness and I think sometimes we lose you know the basic facts of what we&amp;#39;re trying to achieve here it&amp;#39;s super important to understand that there is nobody like Elon I mean he&amp;#39;s truly an N of one in working on issues like this you know so he&amp;#39;s working 20 hours a day he&amp;#39;s working through the weekend his team is in fact sleeping across from the White House and you know in the executive uh office building but most importantly right Elon is a systems thinker I mean he literally showed up in Washington and he didn&amp;#39;t do what normal people do when they show up in Washington which is you know fed you know fed all the politicians and understand you know what he needs to do in order to play by all the rules that everybody else sets he just starts asking questions and not surprisingly the first question he asks is who sends out the wires like who controls the wires can I just get a list of all the wires that are scheduled to go out like what are we what are we spending the money on you know over the next month have they been audited you know and as I think he started doing that of course the Leviathan of Washington just convulses right because they&amp;#39;re like whoa whoa nobody questions nobody nobody looks at the wires he&amp;#39;s like well that&amp;#39;s kind of what you know uh the president asked me to do so I need to do that um and so the antibodies you know uh really started attacking when the only thing he really has to do in the first instance is you know his first principles led him to thinking that you know like where where to look so you know I want to bring it back to this idea that change is hard but change is necessary right we&amp;#39;re simply talking about his whole purpose here is to balance the budget that both parties have proven the inability to do in the normal process um and most people agree it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s bankrupting the country and so it it&amp;#39;s not that hard you know we we showed this on the Pod where we went through if you just return to the Baseline of 2019 Bill if we just go back to the Baseline Grow Up by 2 and a half% from 2019 you balance the budget in This president&amp;#39;s term right but that requires us getting a trillion dollars cut off the covid high we lost our minds remember the the letter to meta time to get fit it was like we lost our mind well silicon Valley&amp;#39;s gotten fit we we&amp;#39;ve made some reductions but government hasn&amp;#39;t gotten fit at all hasn&amp;#39;t done anything except stay at that covid high and all elon&amp;#39;s saying is listen let&amp;#39;s just go back let&amp;#39;s start with just getting a trillion of this out which is you know the excess that we put in and so the other thing that he&amp;#39;s doing is he&amp;#39;s literally live blogging this on Twitter you know he hosted this Doge spaces on Sunday night anybody you know can join this thing it&amp;#39;s not like they&amp;#39;re hiding anything even Sunday nights of euphemism it was at midnight Eastern I which you know to to me I mean I it&amp;#39;s not that I mean I think most people thought that was like him being mischievous I what what I took away I mean the guy works around the clock right that was when he had a free moment right including like two two Congressman Jo yeah and so one of the things I tweeted on Sunday night after that was if we do this and if we tell if we if we tell the American people you know that we&amp;#39;re going to do this and we put together a believable plan where you&amp;#39;re going to cut a trillion dollars and balance the budget in in the next few years I&amp;#39;ll tell you what&amp;#39;s going to happen right interest rates are going to come down right because the whole reason Bond vigilantes moved into the bond market and started shorting it is they thought okay here we go Trump&amp;#39;s going to stimulate the hell out of the economy with a continuation of taxes Etc and nothing&amp;#39;s going to really change on costs and I think the big thing that I came back thinking is people are wrong right like there are there is a fundamental difference in how these folks are attacking uh removing inefficient spending from uh the federal government and getting us back to what is a very sensible 2019 Baseline remember nobody thought in 2019 bill that we were like starving babies in the streets because our spending was so low nobody thought that okay like everybody thought we were spending plenty of money in 2019 and that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re talking about and yet if you watch the convulsion coming out of Washington you would think that you know uh something very Draconian was going on well I mean but you would expect that right like um we don&amp;#39;t have term limits we have lifelong um politicians in Washington they we because of citizens united you basically can raise money unlimited amounts of money from corporate interest I you know I gave the speech a year and a half ago on on regulatory capture I I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not surprised that the The Entity that is Washington pushes back on someone that wants to take away the tools that give them power I&amp;#39;m just not not surprised well I think I think what people expected frankly is you know immediately after people started seeing the relationship with Trump what&amp;#39;s the first thing people did they all started speculating how long until the relationship blows up and you know Trump always fires everybody and and just the opposite is happening and then I think they all expected Elon just to come to Washington not do anything like just to maybe make some recommendations to Congress on things that could be cut but you and I know Eli like there&amp;#39;s no chance he&amp;#39;s going to Washington to just like you you know run some research and make some recommendations so I think that was uh misplaced so let me tell you how I think Doge fits in with a normal budget Pro because I also think this is very misunderstood right so remember I think the way to think about this in your head is we have two tracks going on here track one is the normal budget process and in this case they&amp;#39;re using a a a parliamentary tool called reconciliation okay and basically what that means I&amp;#39;ll spare you the details but this is out of the White House led by Kevin hasset in the house obviously led by the speaker and the house budget committee but B basically Rec reconciliation is a special budget process that allows you to get an Omnibus budget bill past Congress without having to get to the 60 votes in the Senate that is filibuster proof okay and they&amp;#39;re working hard on this I expect some meaningful improvements that will come out of this in spending I suspect that Doge will be offering their ideas how to save some money in this but this is kind of the normal process that occurs in Washington and the president I think has said he wants something to sign out of the reconciliation process in April or May right and so it has to go through this normal all the Committees are going to have their hearings they&amp;#39;re going to put together the budget that they think complies with reconciliation there&amp;#39;s going to be a grand negotiation you know that occurs with 10 people around the table and you know all the horse trading that usually occurs in Washington so that&amp;#39;s track one bill track two is Doge and cuts in spending by executive Authority and this is the part that I think has washed Washington up in arms so that&amp;#39;s what you see that&amp;#39;s causing the fury Elon is advising the president and then the president is deciding in real time whether certain people need and need to be cut and whether certain spending should be stopped and when the answer is no this amount of money and these people are not required to Faithfully execute the laws that I&amp;#39;ve been given they say they&amp;#39;re just going to downside the downsize the executive agency tasked with executing the law and they&amp;#39;re going to stop spending the money that they believe is wasteful and not needed to fulfill the law so they&amp;#39;re saying especially in the face of a national fiscal crisis where we&amp;#39;re falling further and further into a debt spiral we need to do this so they in the town hall on Monday night or on Sunday night you know for example Elon called usaid so this is an organization that&amp;#39;s quite controversial you can research it um that spends $50 billion a year on foreign aid okay um and it has thousands of people in the agency and he said well between I think among employees it&amp;#39;s probably closer to a thousand or two and then a lot of of of of contractors and basically what Elon said on Sunday night is I called the president I told him unfortunately there&amp;#39;s no apple to be saved it&amp;#39;s a total ball of worms if there was just one worm in the Apple we&amp;#39; pull the worm out but the whole thing is a ball of worms so the whole thing needs to be shut down and and we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re going to let thousands of people go and we&amp;#39;re going to save $50,000 on the budget or $50 billion uh on the budget it subsequently looks like on Monday that you know they made a deal where Marco Rubio right who&amp;#39;s the secretary of state is going to become the acting director of the agency and now it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to eliminate whatever they think is wasteful and then they&amp;#39;ll consolidate perhaps other parts of that spending into the state department but basically this is what Bill caused Schumer and folks to come out on Monday morning declare all of this activity unconstitutional to say that you know um nobody elected Elon he can&amp;#39;t do this it&amp;#39;s unconstitutional and this is where I think you&amp;#39;re going the the whole challenge is now going to move but remember this has nothing to do with track one right except you&amp;#39;re angering a lot of people on the Democratic side but this is really about track two does the president have executive Authority not to spend money that they deem is wasteful so you asked me a question um and and and maybe we&amp;#39;ll touch on it for a second uh earlier which is is it constitutional right and so I think that&amp;#39;s a a pretty fascinating constitutional question I&amp;#39;ve consulted with a lot of people I think are experts in the area area and I do expect that Schumer or a group of members as early as this week is going to file uh you know a a claim a lawsuit in federal court where they say that there&amp;#39;s a violation of the Constitution under Article 1 Section 99 Clause 7 where Congress has the power of the pur strings and the Supreme Court you know has long upheld this um you know basically the Supreme Court has said separation of powers generally support the idea that it&amp;#39;s Congress who appropriates funds and anybody else who doesn&amp;#39;t spend those monies that would be unconstitutional so that that&amp;#39;s likely the argument they&amp;#39;re going to make Bill and they&amp;#39;re going to say immediately they got to cease and desist from you know Elon shutting off wires or not spending money or shutting down usaid now I happen to think that&amp;#39;s on pretty weak footing okay but it is go I I I think it&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s on weak footing why so just think about this for a second right the president has the authority to execute the laws and there&amp;#39;s this Doctrine that&amp;#39;s known as empowerment which the courts largely recognize and it&amp;#39;s basically the president saying okay I see the law that we&amp;#39;re supposed to uphold and I don&amp;#39;t need all this money and in fact I have a further and maybe Supreme Duty an overriding duty to the Constitution that supersedes the Constitutional control of the purse to execute Faithfully the laws to protect the general welfare of the American people which he might argue includes protecting the country from bankruptcy right so he&amp;#39;s just saying listen I&amp;#39;m doing my duty yes I&amp;#39;m executing all the laws they told me to execute however I&amp;#39;m doing it for less money and and given that we&amp;#39;re in a national debt crisis I need to do that in order to protect the American people so I think that this is going to eventually come to head imagine it goes to the to the Supreme Court to decide and I think there&amp;#39;s a decent chance along the way that at a minimum think about what what Chuck Schumer&amp;#39;s going to have to defend he&amp;#39;s going to have to defend some of this really crazy spending um that we all know exists I mean I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anybody in either side of this argument who doesn&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a bunch of inefficient and silly spending by the government so effectively that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the what you&amp;#39;re going to have to defend if you want to defend this lawsuit so I think the political pressure is going to be massive that&amp;#39;s brought to bear particularly because doge is being so transparent on this right like you do not want to be defending every single line item to the American people which is exactly what doge is going to put you on the spot to do and so I think two potential outcomes number one the political pressure causes you know them to cut a lot more as part of track one right this reconciliation process or number two that the Supreme Court actually does in fact recognize some more expansive you know executive power around empowerment um but you know I I think either way you know I imagine before this is all said and done bill that we&amp;#39;re going to see headlines that say Elon causing a constitutional crisis right that you know we have the we have the courts involved um and you have the solicitor general that&amp;#39;s that would be ending the executive branch in the White House on on this matter now um bring it home you know and as IID said in the question bring it back like why does this matter for Tech investors what let&amp;#39;s presume it goes either way what what&amp;#39;s it going to mean to how a tech investor should be thinking about the markets and and tech stocks yeah I mean just think about what with the three topics we talked about today the first one was like just massive technological IC uncertainty right like where you you said it it&amp;#39;s a pace of change you&amp;#39;ve never seen in your career highly disruptive multi you know companies that are valued at $150 billion dollar that are being challenged by you know a Chinese uh startup on a Sho string so you and I would both say our ability to forecast the future as to where this is going right is is challenged because it&amp;#39;s moving so fast then we talk about tariffs well massive economic uncertainty bill I mean you know free trade has been generally established as a principle in the economy for the better part of certainly for you you and my entire investment career the markets could count on that and now I&amp;#39;m suggesting at least there&amp;#39;s some probability that this President is going to move in a very different direction right that maybe it&amp;#39;s not the best consensus that maybe it&amp;#39;s something else it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a we might call it the Trump New Normal right where tariffs become standard practice and maybe as a replace income tax so okay there&amp;#39;s a lot of uncertainty around that and now this third one is political right like it&amp;#39;s been a while since we had a looming political constitutional crisis where you know where an issue between the the the Congressional branch and and and the executive branch went to the Supreme Court that also yields a lot of uncertainty when you add these uncertainties up what does it do for the value of assets that you and I look at right you and I are valuing those future cash flows we have to apply a discount rate discount rate measures the risk associated with those future cash flows so you and I have to take the discount rate up why because we&amp;#39;re a lot less certain about technology politics and and and and economics so to me that means multiples come down and asset prices have to come down while the world sifts through all this the surprising thing to me really bill is how well the public markets have held up in the face of all of this right and I think part of that has to do what they believe Trump is going to be a super progrowth president you&amp;#39;re going to have lower taxes Etc but I think that&amp;#39;s the risk on the table as a risk manager what I have to say to my team is okay we&amp;#39;ve got a downsize risk right we we you know you don&amp;#39;t do the 10th best idea right or the 11th best idea you really got to make sure that you have that that you better understand this stuff and so I think for the long-term investor you know perhaps they can just ignore the noise and they could say you know I&amp;#39;m fully invol I&amp;#39;m fully invested I believe in this super cycle AI is going to be great for everything but what I say to our friends at silica Valley is expect way more volatility I think the next 6 months all of this uncertainty means that you&amp;#39;re going to have a lot of volatility it&amp;#39;s exactly what we felt all weekend long it&amp;#39;s exactly why the markets were gapping down overnight on Sunday and then they did this U-turn because we got a change in policy or what appeared to be a change in policy out of the White House and so you know welcome back to 2017 bill um all of this change may be absolutely necessary and totally good for team America um but it&amp;#39;s going to it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to mean that we have more sleepless nights yeah and look I think I think because of so much chaos and because of such massive uncertainty in regulatory action and the fact that it can often backfire I mean I give you the example like when deep seek popped up first of all I think this whole economic thing kind of got blown out of proportion the paper originally said 6 million was just the post training and somebody interpreted that as the whole thing and then it led to but but a lot of people then I would say a lot of Invidia Bulls ran out and said no no no they had way more Nvidia they had way more gpus than they thought well guess what pounding the table on that may cause some in Washington to say oh [ __ ] we should have had higher restrictions so you&amp;#39;re an Nvidia bull think you&amp;#39;re protecting Nvidia by exposing deep seek and you may end up with sanctions that end up hurting nvidia&amp;#39;s revenues so it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a dangerous place to play well I mean you just you just showed I mean you you have all of these forces at play listen what do I do as an investor you know what did I do in the fall of 22 that led me into Nvidia in the first place I just studied what was happening in technology and the company I didn&amp;#39;t have to think about free trade or tariffs I didn&amp;#39;t have to think about export restrictions I didn&amp;#39;t have to think about you know constitutional crisis all I had to figure out is is is the forecast for NVIDIA too low because of the explosion we&amp;#39;re about ready to have an AI and that&amp;#39;s the bet we made and we won big on but now as I sit here today the valuation for aidia is much higher and now I have to take into consideration all these other risks and all I&amp;#39;m saying is all else being created equal I think that the super cycle is is you know if if I&amp;#39;m just doing my fundamental analysis I think it&amp;#39;s on fire I think we&amp;#39;re going to need way more compute than we have I think deep seek unleashes the amount of inference we&amp;#39;re going to need I think deep research out of open AI unleashes that so I think the fundamental is bigger than ever um but at the same time I also am humble in the face of what&amp;#39;s known and knowable about the next 12 months you know uh around tariffs around export controls around all these other risks in the economy and I just think we have to you know you have to look in the mirror and acknowledge that a lot of this is unpredictable and that impacts what what what folks are willing to pay what multiple folks are willing to pay and for our friends in the VC markets right particularly some of these high valued companies you know a mid and late stage VC it&amp;#39;s going to impact right there&amp;#39;s always that lag effect but the public markets and the risk appetite and the multiples they pay that rolls downhill and so I would just say I think that we may get to the back half of this year into next year and it may in fact be the Golden Age and Off to the Races but I think at the moment it&amp;#39;s the Golden Age of uncertainty hey Brad let&amp;#39;s let let&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s well said let let&amp;#39;s close with where we started with this Sovereign wealth fund thing so um pick either the pro or the con make the argument and then I&amp;#39;ll take the other side well I mean like I I think you saw me post in our thread as a general matter right I&amp;#39;m uh you you know I love the fact that we have people with B business sensibilities and and incentives looking out for America who want to negotiate on behalf of America right and who you know we sell we sell Wireless spectrum and licenses right I would love to see that go to the benefit of of all the citizens in the country you know we we you know have uh you know drilling licenses on National lands that&amp;#39;s that that money belongs to the citizens so I love that idea you know in the fund here&amp;#39;s my challenge with it Bill we have 40 trillion in debt and we probably have another 50 trillion of unfunded liabilities so we&amp;#39;re a debor nation and we&amp;#39;re paying 5% on all that debt so the hurdle rate to our return that is needed on The Sovereign wealth fund right is 5% otherwise you would just take all those monies and you would pay down the debt right if this was our personal balance sheet so what you and I would describe this is is we&amp;#39;re Levering up the balance sheet of the United States to earn the spread between the Sovereign wealth fund returns and the 5% that we&amp;#39;re paying to borrow all the money so I think net net I probably have it in place because I think it&amp;#39;s a good tactical lever um you know I do worry about what administration Administration it could lead to some crony capitalism and deal making that benefits certain people Etc so I I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s a close call for me but I think it&amp;#39;s going to happen either way I would you took both sides so I&amp;#39;ll do a quick a quick both sides yeah I mean in addition to the scenarios you talked about and you and I have debated this in the past but if I look at Goldman Sachs GM even United like if the government&amp;#39;s going to be the lender of Last Resort I would argue they should take all of the equity and this could be a vehicle for that although there&amp;#39;s nothing that&amp;#39;s kept the government from doing that I think in the GM case they did take Equity so it&amp;#39;s like it it it has done it in the past without the vehicle I&amp;#39;m way more skeptical than you on the crony capitalism it would be a 99% certainty that this asset would be rated um through from from transition to transition in the government and I would highight that probably the most successful Sovereign wealth funds in the world um are all in autocracies they&amp;#39;re not in democracies um I I I I think I I don&amp;#39;t agree I don&amp;#39;t agree with that I don&amp;#39;t agree with that I mean from from from Norway with Nores to to Korea to Canada we have a lot of great Sovereign wealth funds um but I do think you know that&amp;#39;s I think one of the things I would say in all those countries what you do have Bill is consistency and Independence in the management of The Sovereign wealth fund independent from like some unilateral control by the by the executive branch and then and then if if you want to see how I can go really wrong uh please go read billion dooll whale it&amp;#39;s one of the most uh exciting books you could possibly read about what happened to the Malaysian Sovereign wealth fund U so well um um as always it&amp;#39;s fun to get together thanks for making the time we&amp;#39;ll talk soon all right [Music] as a reminder to everybody just our opinions not investment advice
